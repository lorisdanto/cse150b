(OPTIONAL) Assignment 5: Sudoku
=========

# PA5 is OPTIONAL. The original 5 points allocated to PA5 will be given for free to everyone.


Task
-----
Implement a constraint solver for Sudoku puzzles using backtracking search. Pseudocode is given in `pseudocode.pdf`. 

When making decisions, we recommend using the heuristic of **choosing an unassigned variable with the smallest domain**. You can see the difference with and without this heuristic. But as long as you pass the following tests, you do not have to use this heuristic. 

Setting up
-----

We'll use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) again.
```
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Usage & Tests
-----

For testing, there are four options you can use with `uv run main.py -t <TEST_NUM>`: 
- 0: "Propagation only" test. A really simple test case that can be solved without search.
- 1: "Propagation and search" test. A hard test case that requires both propagation and search.
- 2: Provides 50 easy test cases. 
- 3: Provides 50 hard test cases. 

We set a 20 seconds timeout on each instance. To pass the tests, you can timeout on 2 instances in the easy class ('-t 2') and up to 30 instances in the hard class ('-t 3'), because the runtime may have large variance based on your branching methods.

Extension
-----
This extension task is designed to be a bit "research-oriented" and encourages you to explore more on the topic of SAT solving. It is completely optional. 

The extension task is to implement an encoding of Sudoku as propositional logic formulas in conjunctive normal forms, and use a state-of-the-art SAT solver to solve. Read the `cnf-notes.pdf` file for more details on the format of the encoding. The `example.cnf` file shows an example of the file format. 

You need to solve the same puzzles but through generating CNF files. In the `ai.py` file there are function templates you can use. Pass the encodings to a SAT solver (see below) to solve, and then parse the output from the SAT solver and plug them back into the original problem, and put the solutions in the same format (pass them as domains to the test scripts). You can run "uv run main.py -e" with the same "-t" options as above, to test the results using SAT solvers. 

If you have done things correctly, you should see that all hard puzzles will be solved quickly (most of the time is spent on creating the CNF file). 

SAT Solvers to Use: The source code of the popular picosat solver [PicoSAT](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) is already included as a directory. In that directory, simply do `./configure.sh` and then `make` to build the tool, and then the binary `picosat` can take the CNF files you produce (always use extension `.cnf`). Try the example.cnf file with it (first move the picosat executable to the top directory and then `./picosat example.cnf`). Note that the test script also assumes that `picosat` is in the same directory of as the `main.py` file, so make sure to move it to the right place after you've built it. 

We highly recommend using linux/mac machine to compile and run picosat. If you have to use windows, this [note](https://gist.github.com/ConstantineLignos/4601835) may be helpful but haven't verified. Can also look into using PicoSAT with [Ubuntu with VirtualBox](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview) which was verified to work (thanks Matt Taylor!). If you have difficulty in getting PicoSAT to work, try [cryptominisat](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat) which has more instructions about making things work on windows.
